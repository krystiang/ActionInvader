# Gesture-Detection-Agent

Provides gesture recognition for the gestures used by Action-Invader-Project (http://devsupportgit.informatik.haw-hamburg.de/projekt15/action-invader-project). 
It receives skeleton data and interprets it with given rules to determine if the skeleton data represents a defined gesture. If that is the case the gesture is
published so that Action-Invader-Project receives it.
